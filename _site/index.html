        </h2>
        <p></p>
        I am an undergraduate research assistant with the <a href="https://physics.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physics Department</a> at Washington University in St. Louis, working under <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/errando/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Dr. Manel Errando </a> in the field of High-Energy Astrophysics.
        <p></p>
        I grew up 9 miles outside of Chicago, IL, a quick train ride away from <a href="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adler Planetarium</a>, where my fascination with space began. I attended <a href="https://www.oprfhs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Oak Park and River Forest High School</a> where I played <a href="https://www.oakpark.com/?s=Cassie%20Metzger%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">softball</a> for a number of years.      
        <p></p>
        <div class="codebox">
            I am particularly fascinated by black holes. My current work resides in the field of experimental astrophysics and focuses on studying the <a href="https://www.nustar.caltech.edu/page/relativistic_jets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relativistic jets</a> emitted by <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-are-active-galactic-nuclei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)</a> using data from the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/wide-field-infrared-survey-explorer-wise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WISE</a> and <a href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eROSITA</a> satellites. However, I am also interested in computational physics, particularly in developing models for accretion and particle acceleration within supermassive black holes (SMBH) and SMBH formation and evolution.

        <h2 clss="mb-5">🪐 research</h2>
            I began conducting research in <a href="https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/manel-errando" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manel Errando</a>'s lab in the fall of my sophomore year. I was drawn to the lab because of its focus on active galactic nuclei (AGN). Since I first learned about black holes at a planetarium show, I knew that I wanted to study the mysteries behind them. I was quickly captivated by the lab's focus on the high energy emissions from AGN. I have since presented my research at the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) in 2023 and 2024, the Washington University Undergraduate Research Symposium (Spring 2023, <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/errando/students-present-at-the-undergraduate-research-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Fall 2023</a>), and the Washington University Physics Research Symposium (WUPRS) in 2023 where I was awarded <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/errando/cassie-wins-poster-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first place</a>. Below, I'll highlight my two major research projects.

        <u><b><i>Abstract</i></b>:</u> Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are active supermassive black holes that reside at galactic centers. Approximately 10% of AGN are capable of launching a collimated stream of matter via magnetic fields that consist of particles accelerated near the speed of light. This phenomenon is known as a relativistic jet. However, the mechanisms that power relativistic jets are primarily unknown. We theorize that these mechanisms are exaggerated in the case of extremely powerful jets. Thus, we aim to conduct a survey of the most powerful relativistic jets. We categorize a jet as “extremely powerful” when it reaches TeV energies. To do this, we enforce parameters in the X-ray and infrared wavelengths based on objects that are confirmed to be producing relativistic jets that reach TeV energies. Using these parameters, we develop an algorithm that searches through infrared and X-ray data to select sources that fall within the parameters set. In the future, we intend to use the outputs of this algorithm to construct a catalog that will serve as a target list for future gamma-ray observatories.

        <u><b><i>Abstract</i></b>:</u> While all Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) commonly vary in X-ray emission on short time scales, it has been noted by several papers that this flux variability seems to be inversely correlated with the mass of the black hole (e.g., Lu &amp; Yu 2001; Papadakis 2004; McHardy et al. 2006). This  correlation implies that black holes with greater variability are less massive. Therefore, if X-ray variability is great and the black hole is accreting near its Eddington limit, it can be inferred that this is a growing black hole. Our research focuses on a dataset of the AGN 2MASX J20082452-444095 that spans several years (2011-2019) and was collected with the X-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite. We study the long-term X-ray variability of J2008 in order to understand the growth rate of its central black hole.

            I am the president of WashU's chapter of <a href="https://www.spsnational.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Society of Physics Students (SPS)</a>. SPS is a national organization geared towards promoting undergraduate involvement in the field of physics. Our chapter contributes to this goal by providing WashU undergraduates interested in physics with information and resources. We also work hard to faciliate events that foster connections within the department as a whole. To learn more about our chapter as a whole, you can visit our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/washu_sps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>.
            
        <p></p>
        I became involved with SPS in January 2023 when I was elected as Vice President. During my term as VP, I focused on campus outreach and public relations. I ran our Instagram account and worked to increase our presence on campus by hosting a variety of events. During my term as VP, our chapter membership increased from 60 to 100 members. I was then elected President in January 2024. During my first semester as President, I instated two additional officer positions, Public Relations Chair and Event Coordination Chair, I also instated two boards beneath each of the officers focused on public outreach and event planning. Chapter membership continued to increase steadily during this time. Below, I'll highlight some of the major events that I directed during my time as an SPS officer.

        <br />
        <u><b><i>Description</i></b>:</u> As a form of outreach, I designed a liquid nitrogen social event. The event was open to all WashU students and was designed to be a kind of spectacle. It was first hosted at the beginning of the 2023 Fall semester. The intention was to reach a wider audience of students. We certaintly saw success, serving approximately 100 students. The event was then hosted again at the end of the 2024 spring semester where approximately 80 students were served. Following both events, we witnessed a notable increase in chapter interest.

        <u><b><i>Description</i></b>:</u> The event featured a variety of WashU Physics professors. Each presented brief descriptions of their research before answering questions from panelists and then the student body in attendance. The event was designed to give undergraduate students a look into the world of physics reseearch and present them with the opportunities available to them. Following the event, we were excited to report an increase in undergraduate reserch involvement.

        <br />
        <u><b><i>Description</i></b>:</u> As SPS is a national organization, collaboration between chapters is strongly encouraged. One of the ways that collaboration occurs is through meetings between chapters that are in the same zone. WashU, alongside the rest of Missouri schools, Kansas, and many Oklahoma schools fall into Zone 12. The meeting was hosted at WashU for the first time since 2008. The event was a great success. Beginning on a Friday, students got together for dinner followed by a physics-themed Jeporady game. Then, on Saturday, students navigated through a series of panels and lectures. The feedback from the event was overwhelmingly positive.

        With a semester still remaining in my term, I hope to bring our SPS chapter beyond WashU to promote physics/astronomy education within the St. Louis community. I plan to foster a connection between our chapter and local schools to promote an astronomy curriculum.

        <h2 clss="mb-5">✨ teaching</h2>
        Math and science, especially physics, were not subjects that came easily to me. For the majority of elementary school, middle school, and high school, I performed average at best in those classes. It was due to the teachers and tutors that recognized my passion, irregardless of my natural talent, and helped me along the way that I was able to learn math and physics in a way that worked for me. Today, I am passionate about teaching math and physics. I especially enjoy working with students who are struggling in those subjects. I firmly believe that all students have the potential to excel in STEM. Everyone learns in their own ways and through my own experiences as a student and a teacher, I've learned that many students who struggle in STEM fields simply learn differently than students who are naturally drawn to STEM subjects. As a teacher/tutor today, I make it my goal to find the best way to teach each of my students individually.
        <p></p>
        At WashU, I am involved with teaching physics through WashU's Learning Center and the Physics Department directly.

I work with a group of 8-15 students for two hours a week. We work through a series of problems that are above the level of the class and are designed to challenge students and force them to learn the material on a deeper level. I act a faciliator, guiding the students through the questions with the aim of teaching them how to work through the problems themselves. However, I do also regularly provide explanations and help when needed.

During the school year, I hosted "WUSA Hours" for two hours each week. I would organize a variety of activities to help my students bond and generally just act as a resource for students. I regularly provided academic advice and discussed my own experiences as a student at WashU.

        <u><b><i>Description</i></b>:</u> I worked as an assistant coach for the Chicago Ravens 12U Softball team. I helped run practices and develop lineups for games. I often worked with pitchers specifically by calling pitches during games, providing in-game coaching advice, and offering guidance during practices. However, of the wide array of tasks I undertook as a coach, the most important was ensuring that every player on the team was able to enjoy the game. I did my best to provide each player with the tools they needed to have fun and succeed, both in the game and in their endeavors outside of practice.

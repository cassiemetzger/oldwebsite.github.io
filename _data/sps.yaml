first-paragraph: I am the president of WashU's chapter of <a href="https://www.spsnational.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Society of Physics Students (SPS)</a>. SPS is a national organization geared towards promoting undergraduate involvement in the field of physics. Our chapter contributes to this goal by providing WashU undergraduates interested in physics with information and resources. We also work hard to faciliate events that foster connections within the department as a whole.

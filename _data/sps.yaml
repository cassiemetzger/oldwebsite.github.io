first-paragraph: I am the president of WashU's chapter of <a href="https://www.spsnational.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Society of Physics Students (SPS)</a>. SPS is a national organization geared towards promoting undergraduate involvement in the field of physics. Our chapter contributes to this goal by providing WashU undergraduates interested in physics with information and resources. We also work hard to faciliate events that foster connections within the department as a whole. To learn more about our chapter as a whole, you can visit our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/washu_sps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>. 
second-paragraph: I became involved with SPS in January 2023 when I was elected as Vice President. During my term as VP, I focused on campus outreach and public relations. I ran our Instagram account and worked to increase our presence on campus by hosting a variety of events. During my term as VP, our chapter membership increased from 60 to 100 members. I was then elected President in January 2024. During my first semester as President, I instated two additional officer positions, Public Relations Chair and Event Coordination Chair, I also instated two boards beneath each of the officers focused on public outreach and event planning. Chapter membership continued to increase steadily during this time. Below, I'll highlight some of the major events that I directed during my time as an SPS officer.

    event: Fall 2023 
    description: As a form of outreach, I designed a liquid nitrogen social event. The event was open to all WashU students and was designed to be a kind of spectacle. It was first hosted at the beginning of the 2023 Fall semester. The intention was to reach a wider audience of students. We certaintly saw success, serving approximately 100 students. The event was then hosted again at the end of the 2024 spring semester where approximately 80 students were served. Following both events, we witnessed a notable increase in chapter interest.

    event: Fall 2023
    description: The event featured a variety of WashU Physics professors. Each presented brief descriptions of their research before answering questions from panelists and then the student body in attendance. The event was designed to give undergraduate students a look into the world of physics reseearch and present them with the opportunities available to them. Following the event, we were excited to report an increase in undergraduate reserch involvement. 
  
  - title: Zone 12 Meeting

    event: Spring 2024

    description: As SPS is a national organization, collaboration between chapters is strongly encouraged. One of the ways that collaboration occurs is through meetings between chapters that are in the same zone. WashU, alongside the rest of Missouri schools, Kansas, and many Oklahoma schools fall into Zone 12. The meeting was hosted at WashU for the first time since 2008. The event was a great success. Beginning on a Friday, students got together for dinner followed by a physics-themed Jeporady game. Then, on Saturday, students navigated through a series of panels and lectures. The feedback from the event was overwhelmingly positive. 

third-paragraph: With a semester still remaining in my term, I hope to bring our SPS chapter beyond WashU to promote physics/astronomy education within the St. Louis community. I plan to foster a connection between our chapter and local schools to promote an astronomy curriculum.

first-paragraph: Math and science, especially physics, were not subjects that came easily to me. For the majority of elementary school, middle school, and high school, I performed average at best in those classes. It was due to the teachers and tutors that recognized my passion, irregardless of my natural talent, and helped me along the way that I was able to learn math and physics in a way that worked for me. Today, I am passionate about teaching math and physics. I especially enjoy working with students who are struggling in those subjects. I firmly believe that all students have the potential to excel in STEM. Everyone learns in their own ways and through my own experiences as a student and a teacher, I've learned that many students who struggle in STEM fields simply learn differently than students who are naturally drawn to STEM subjects. As a teacher/tutor today, I make it my goal to find the best way to teach each of my students individually. 
second-paragraph: At WashU, I am involved with teaching physics through WashU's Learning Center and the Physics Department directly. 

mini-projects:

  - title: Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) 
    event: Fall 2022 - Present
    gif: assets/img/learning_center.png
    description: I began working as a PLTL Leader the fall of my sophomore year. As a PLTL leader, I facilitate weekly group sessions for students in WashU's introductory physics sequence (<a href="https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=L&dept=L31&crs=191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physics 191</a> and <a href="https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=L&dept=L31&crs=192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physics 192</a>). I work with a group of 8-15 students for two hours a week. We work through a series of problems that are above the level of the class and are designed to challenge students and force them to learn the material on a deeper level. I act a faciliator, guiding the students through the questions with the aim of teaching them how to work through the problems themselves. However, I do also regularly provide explanations and help when needed. 

  - title: Physics 191/192 Recitation Leader

    event: Spring 2023 - Present 
    description: As a physics recitation leader for the introductory physics sequence, I work with approximately 30 students for one hour a week. The students work in small groups while I walk around and answer questions. I also provide brief content reviews in a short lecture format as necessary. 

  - title: Washington University Student Associate (WUSA)
    event: Summer 2022 - Spring 2023
    gif: assets/img/wusa.jpg
    description: As a WUSA, I worked with a cohort of 15 incoming first-years to help them acclimate to college. I assisted in organizing orientation week activities and met with my students for several hours each day during orientation week. During the school year, I hosted "WUSA Hours" for two hours each week. I would organize a variety of activities to help my students bond and generally just act as a resource for students. I regularly provided academic advice and discussed my own experiences as a student at WashU.
  - title: Assistant softball coach 
    event: Summer 2022 
    gif: assets/img/ravens.jpg
    description: I worked as an assistant coach for the Chicago Ravens 12U Softball team. I helped run practices and develop lineups for games. I often worked with pitchers specifically by calling pitches during games, providing in-game coaching advice, and offering guidance during practices. However, of the wide array of tasks I undertook as a coach, the most important was ensuring that every player on the team was able to enjoy the game. I did my best to provide each player with the tools they needed to have fun and succeed, both in the game and in their endeavors outside of practice.

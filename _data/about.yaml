# about me
first-paragraph: I am an undergraduate research assistant with the <a href="https://physics.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physics Department</a> at Washington University in St. Louis, working under <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/errando/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Dr. Manel Errando </a> in the field of High-Energy Astrophysics. 
second-paragraph: I grew up 9 miles outside of Chicago, IL, a quick train ride away from <a href="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/" target="_blank" rel = "noopener">Adler Planetarium</a>, where my fascination with space began. I attended <a href="https://www.oprfhs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Oak Park and River Forest High School</a> where I played <a href="https://www.oakpark.com/?s=Cassie%20Metzger%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">softball</a> for a number of years. 
research-introduction: I am particularly fascinated by black holes. My current work resides in the field of experimental astrophysics and focuses on studying the <a href="https://www.nustar.caltech.edu/page/relativistic_jets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relativistic jets</a> emitted by <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-are-active-galactic-nuclei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)</a> using data from the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/wide-field-infrared-survey-explorer-wise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WISE</a> and <a href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eROSITA</a> satellites. However, I am also interested in computational physics, particularly in developing models for accretion and particle acceleration within supermassive black holes (SMBH) and SMBH formation and evolution.

research-interests:

  - field: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
    subfields: high-energy astrophysics (X-ray, gamma-ray), relativistic jets, modelling accretion and particle acceleration
  
  - field: Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH)
    subfields: SMBH formation and evolution, SMBH mergers, gravitational waves

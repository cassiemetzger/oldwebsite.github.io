    abstract-less: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are active supermassive black holes that reside at galactic centers. Approximately 10% of AGN are capable of launching a collimated stream of matter via magnetic fields that consist of particles accelerated near the speed of light. This phenomenon is known as a relativistic jet. However, the mechanisms that power relativistic jets are primarily unknown. 
    abstract-more: We theorize that these mechanisms are exaggerated in the case of extremely powerful jets. Thus, we aim to conduct a survey of the most powerful relativistic jets. We categorize a jet as “extremely powerful” when it reaches TeV energies. To do this, we enforce parameters in the X-ray and infrared wavelengths based on objects that are confirmed to be producing relativistic jets that reach TeV energies. Using these parameters, we develop an algorithm that searches through infrared and X-ray data to select sources that fall within the parameters set. In the future, we intend to use the outputs of this algorithm to construct a catalog that will serve as a target list for future gamma-ray observatories

  - title: Studying Accretion onto an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH)

    abstract-less: While all Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) commonly vary in X-ray emission on short time scales, it has been noted by several papers that this flux variability seems to be inversely correlated with the mass of the black hole (e.g., Lu & Yu 2001; Papadakis 2004; McHardy et al. 2006). This  correlation implies that black holes with greater variability are less massive. 
    abstract-more: Therefore, if X-ray variability is great and the black hole is accreting near its Eddington limit, it can be inferred that this is a growing black hole3. Our research focuses on a dataset of the AGN 2MASX J20082452-444095 that spans several years (2011-2019) and was collected with the X-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite. We study the long-term X-ray variability of J2008 in order to understand the growth rate of its central black hole.

    abstract-less: Calibration is the first and foremost step in dealing with sensor displacement errors that can appear during extended operation and off-time periods to enable robot object manipulation with precision. In this paper, we present a novel multiplanar self-calibration between the 
    abstract-more: camera system and the robot's end-effector for 3D object manipulation. Our approach first takes the robot end-effector as ground truth to calibrate the camera’s position and orientation while the robot arm moves the object in multiple planes in 3D space, and a 2D state-of-the-art vision detector identifies the object’s center in the image coordinates system. The transformation between world coordinates and image coordinates is then computed using 2D pixels from the detector and 3D known points obtained by robot kinematics. Next, an integrated stereo-vision system estimates the distance between the camera and the object, resulting in 3D object localization. We test our proposed method on the Baxter robot with two 7-DOF arms and a 2D detector that can run in real time on an onboard GPU. After self-calibrating, our robot can localize objects in 3D using an RGB camera and depth image.

    abstract-less: As the reliability of the robot's perception correlates with the number of integrated sensing modalities to tackle uncertainty, a practical solution to manage these sensors from different computers, operate them simultaneously, and maintain their real-time performance on the existing robotic system with minimal effort is needed. In this work, we present an end-to-end software-hardware 
    abstract-more: framework, namely <i>ExtPerFC</i>, that supports both conventional hardware and software components and integrates machine learning object detectors without requiring an additional dedicated graphic processor unit (GPU). We first design our framework to achieve real-time performance on the existing robotic system, guarantee configuration optimization, and concentrate on code reusability. We then mathematically model and utilize our transfer learning strategies for 2D object detection and fuse them into depth images for 3D depth estimation. Lastly, we systematically test the proposed framework on the Baxter robot with two 7-DOF arms, a four-wheel mobility base, and an Intel RealSense D435i RGB-D camera. The results show that the robot achieves real-time performance while executing other tasks (<i>e.g.</i>, map building, localization, navigation, object detection, arm moving, and grasping) simultaneously with available hardware like Intel onboard CPUs/GPUs on distributed computers. Also, to comprehensively control, program, and monitor the robot system, we design and introduce an end-user application.

    abstract-less: In this paper, we present a low-maintenance, wind-powered, batteryfree, biocompatible, tree wearable, and intelligent sensing system, namely <i>IoTree</i>, to monitor water and nutrient levels inside a living tree. <i>IoTree</i> system includes tiny-size, biocompatible, and implantable sensors that 
    abstract-more: continuously measure the impedance variations inside the living tree’s xylem, where water and nutrients are transported from the root to the upper parts. The collected data are then compressed and transmitted to a base station located at up to 1.8 kilometers (approximately 1.1 miles) away. The entire <i>IoTree</i> system is powered by wind energy and controlled by an adaptive computing technique called block-based intermittent computing, ensuring the forward progress and data consistency under intermittent power and allowing the firmware to execute with the most optimal memory and energy usage. We prototype <i>IoTree</i> that opportunistically performs sensing, data compression, and long-range communication tasks without batteries. During in-lab experiments, <i>IoTree</i> also obtains the accuracy of 91.08% and 90.51% in measuring 10 levels of nutrients, NH<sub>3</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. While tested with Burkwood Viburnum and White Bird trees in the indoor environment, <i>IoTree</i> data strongly correlated with multiple watering and fertilizing events. We also deployed <i>IoTree</i> on a grapevine farm for 30 days, and the system is able to provide sufficient measurements every day.
